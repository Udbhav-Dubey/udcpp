## 🎯 Project Overview

### 🏆 Codeforces (`cf/`)
A collection of problems solved from Codeforces contests, covering algorithmic challenges and competitive programming topics. Problems are organized by contest or topic for systematic practice.

### 📚 CSES (`cses/`)
Contains solutions for the CSES Problem Set, which is a structured collection of algorithmic problems covering fundamental algorithms and data structures. This folder helps reinforce competitive programming skills.

### 💻 LeetCode (`lc/`)
A compilation of LeetCode problems solved by me, focusing on problem-solving strategies and efficient algorithm implementation.

### 🌐 Networking (`networking/`)
Hands-on socket programming and networking exercises. Includes small projects demonstrating client-server communication, TCP/UDP protocols, and networked applications.

### 📝 Source Code (`src/`)
A sandbox for various C++ snippets, exercises, and experiments done while learning the language. Useful for testing concepts, algorithms, and small programs.
