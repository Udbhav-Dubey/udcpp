## 🎯 Project Overview

### 📚 CSES (Competitive Programming)
**Status**: In Progress | **Target Completion**: End of May 2026

The CSES Problem Set is a collection of competitive programming practice problems that cover various algorithms and data structures. This folder contains my solutions as I work through them systematically.


### 💻 LeetCode Solutions
A collection of LeetCode problems I've solved my self 



### 🎮 Maze Game Project
A fully functional maze escape game featuring procedural generation, AI bots, and competitive gameplay.

**Key Features**:
- **Backend**: C++17 with raw socket programming
- **Frontend**: HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript with modern UI
